# raxmlGUI-binaries

A place to host binaries used by [raxmlGUI](https://github.com/AntonelliLab/raxmlGUI).

Binaries are added in releases, tagged by date, enabling raxmlGUI to automatically download binaries for the current platform in a CI/CD pipeline in Github Actions.

RAxML is no longer actively maintained, therefore the binaries for RAxML are compiled from this repository:
